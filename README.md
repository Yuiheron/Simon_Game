# Simon_Game

Developed following Angela Yu course in Udemy.

The HTML and CSS came from the course but I created the JavaScript functionality myself.

I added some modification that isn't listed, such as playing the entire sequence of the answer entirely. I also made that you need to press the "A" key on your keyboard to start the game instead of any keys on your keyboard

Finally some basic practice such as using const/let instead of var as using var can cause issue in the long run if I wish to update this project.
